Coursework with OpenGL

How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software by taking into consideration the requirements for the project and brainstorming ways to achieve each goal.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
My work on this project has helped me to craft design skills in scenery, lighting, and positioning. I've also gained skills in texturing, and in general concepts of bringing ideas to life.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
My design process for this project consisted of tackling one object at a time. I started with the easiest object first, which was a cube, and progressively worked on the more difficult objects, like the cylinder for the vase and the flowers.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Tactics such as building little by little, or incrementally, is typically the most recommended form of programming that I've been exposed to. I would continue on with this tactic in my future work because those building blocks of incremental design always lead to an end result that is easier to debug and change.

How do I approach developing programs?
I approach developing programs similarly to how I design software. Either way, both paths start by taking into account what the requirements of the project are. Even if it is just brainstorming a design idea, or actually putting those ideas to work through code, I need to fundamentally understand what is being asked of me.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
A new development strategy I used while working on my scene was starting with easiest objects first and then moving on to harder objects. Usually it's the other way around for me, but since Open GL was so new to me, I knew I had to be comfortable working with primitive shapes before trying to make a complex object. Had I started with the vase of flowers first, I surely would have been lost (even more so than I already was!).

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration is helpful because it is the act of doing something over and over again. This is one of the best ways to practice a new skill because certain things begin to "click" in your mind and cpncepts begin to fall into place.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
My approach did not evolve throughout the milestones, though if it had, I probably would not have struggled so much in certain Modules that required more work than others. I would approach that differently in the future.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Since I want to work in the industry, Computer Science is a fundamental aspect of reaching that goal. Without the education, I could never have a promising future in software development due to a lack of knowledge.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
I can continue to build upon my knowledge from this course in order to build my toolbox with stronger graphics work. 

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Professionally, computer graphics and visualizations help me to understand another facet of the software development industry. There are many people who make a career out of design and rendering graphics, whether it be for games or for other uses. It is good to have an understanding on other areas of the career field.
